## About 
#### This is a React app used to solve puzzles. Currently, it only solves Sudoku puzzles, but more puzzles will be added soon. 

## Notes
#### Project is still in development, so there may be some bugs
#### Currently there is no way to check if Sudoku puzzles are valid, i.e., there is no way to check if the puzzle has more than one solution. 
#### Crypogram solver will be added to this project soon.
