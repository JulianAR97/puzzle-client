# Notes
### Project is still in development, so there may be some bugs
### Currently there is no way to check if a puzzle has more than one solution, but it's being worked on
### The puzzle solver does not currently function as a playable game in any meaningful way, as you cannot take cell notes and can mutate cells that are part of the puzzle itself. This is also being worked on
### Cryptogram solver will be added to this project soon
